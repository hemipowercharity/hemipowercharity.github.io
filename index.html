                        <h3>What is Hemiplegia?</h3>
                        <p>Hemiplegia is a condition characterised by weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body. Hemiplegia is caused by an injury, damage or deformity to one side of the brain. This can happen because of a stroke, traumatic injury (both of these before or after birth), brain tumours or infections which affect the brain. Often the first sign of hemiplegia is a child using one arm or hand much more than the other. </p>
                        <p>>Research shows us that early intervention is very important for children with hemiplegia, but lots of families find it difficult to access these interventions, or don’t have the right support to be able to implement them at home. </p>

                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>As part of a project funded by the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR) and supported by Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust and King’s College London, parents and therapists worked together to identify the challenges faced by parents of children with hemiplegia, and to develop solutions. Throughout the project, several parents reported that they had never been told about evidence-based interventions, or that there was a significant lack of information or signposting at the point of diagnosis. Some parents, upon noticing that a child used one arm more than the other, raised concerns with professionals, only for no action to be taken, or for the professional to not know how to respond. </p>
                        <p>From this came the creation of Hemipower- a dedicated platform providing families with accessible, evidence-based guidance on rehabilitation for children with hemiplegia. One of their main resources is a booklet, designed to offer practical information, reassurance, and strategies tailored for parents navigating the early stages of their journey. </p>
                        <p>To address this concern, the group decided to develop an information booklet. This booklet is mostly aimed at parents of children who are just receiving a diagnosis, but is also likely to be helpful to professionals supporting children with hemiplegia and their families. The booklet focuses on strategies to improve arm and hand use. </p>
